    <div class="flexbox-item">
     <p>As a newspaper reporter out of college I developed interview skills to get solid data for news stories. I was the lone employee and was responsible for many aspects of the weekly newspaper including editing, photography while focusing on time management and pre-press standards to get the paper to the printer every week. From there I joined a large daily newspaper working in page layout and graphic design of advertising and marketing pieces.  Adhering to tight deadlines and quick turnarounds was essential.  My visual design skills blossomed producing mom n’ pop advertising to large department stores and automotive dealerships.</p> 
     <p>working full time in the Visual design field my whole life, I have also kept my skills sharp by taking a variety of visual design and web design courses over the years and a variety of schools. I've also used lynda.com, LinkedIn learning and work place training to stay on top of trends and new features.</p>
    <p>For the past 8 years I have been an Art Director for thriving B2B company producing several large high-quality catalogs. Coordinating copy, photography, marketing and visual design on a daily basis is the norm. I recently pivoted to more of a web-based focus taking an intense 6 month boot camp for User Experience, User Interface and front-end coding and I'm very exciting in the trajectory of my career… let's keep exploring!</P>
